# ES6
* you can think about ES6 as a javascript next version
* ES5 supported by all browsers, ES6 needs polyfills and transpilers
* you can think about ES6 as a javascript next version
* ES5 supported by all browsers, ES6 needs polyfills and transpilers
1. es6 compatibility with browsers
	* compiler: ES6 -> ES5 (temporary until browsers will support es6)
	* module loader: webpack, jspm
	* server: nodejs
1. `let`, `const`
    * no hoisting (moving declarations to the top of their scope)
	* let - block scope
	* `const` - can't change reference
1. lambda, fat arrow (=>)
    * `this` value of the enclosing lexical scope
1. default parameters: `var eq = (a, b = 0) => a === b`
1. rest operator, ...
    ```
   	function sumUp(...toAdd) {
   		...
   	}
    ```
	* in short words, converts argument list into an array: `sumUp(1,2,3,4) -> sumUp([1,2,3,4])`
1. spread operator, ...
    ```
   	let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
   	console.log(...numbers); // 1 \n 2 \n 3 ...
   	console.log(Math.max(...numbers)); // without ... NAN
    ```
1. the for-of loop
    ```
   	let xxx = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   	for (let x of xxx) {
   		console.log(x);
   	}
    ```
1. template literals, `${}`
    ```
   	let name = 'max';
   	let description = `Hello, Im ${name}`;
    ```
1. desctructuring array
    ```
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    let [a, b] = numbers;
    console.log(a); // 1
    console.log(b); // 2
    ```
    ```
    let [a, ...b] = numbers;
    console.log(b) // 2, 3
    ```
    ```
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    let [a, ,c] = numbers;
    // a = 1, c = 3
    ``` 
    * undefined if value has no equivalent  
1. desctructuring objects
    ```
   	let obj = {
   		name: 'aa'
   		age: 27
   		greet: a => console.log('a');
   	
   	}
   	let {name, age: age22} = obj; // age22 - alias
    ```
1. classes
    ```
   	class X {
   		constructor(name) {
   			this._name = name; // private field
   		}
   	
   		get name() { // bind to property
            return this._name;
        }
   
        set name(newName) { // binds to property
            this._name = newName;
        }
   	}
   	
   	let x = new X();
   	console.log(x.name);
    x.name = 'a';
    ```
1. importing / exporting
	* `external.js`
		`export let keyValue = 1000; // function could also be exported`
	* `script.js`
	    ```
   		import {keyValue} from './external.js';
   		console.log(keyValue); // 1000
        ```
	* exported value is only reference (it is not copied)
	* export default - only one, can have any value
	* aliases (keyValue as xxx)
	* as xxx (object key-value pair)
	* class could be exported
1. modules are always in Strict Mode (no need to define "use strict")
1. each module has its own scope
1. maps and sets
	
# introduction
1. transclusion - include one document inside another
1. transpile - converting source code of one programming language to another (ES6 -> ES5)
	* typescript is transpiled into javascript
1. DOM - representation of html inside web browser memory
1. html - custom attributes
	* attribute: `<h1 style = "asd">` - style is attribute
	* custom attribute: `<h1 customAttribute = 'asd'>`
		* `console.log($("h1").attr("customAttribute")) // asd`
		* `ng-` - custom attribute, that angular may know
1. the global namespace
	* namespace is a container for variables and functions
	* js doesnâ€™t provide namespace by default - anything we create 
	is global by default (global namespace pollution)
        ```
        var MYAPPLICATION = {
            calculateTax: function (item) {
                return item * 1.40;
            },
            product: function (cost) {
                this.cost = cost;
                this.getCost = function () {
                    return this.cost;
                };
            },
            doTaxCalculations: function () {
                var p = new MYAPPLICATION.product(100);
                console.log(this.calculateTax(p.getCost()));
            }
        };
        ```
	* window object is the global object
1. minification vs compression
	* minification - removing unnecessary stuff: ex. spaces, comments, making shorter variable names
	* compression: ex. Huffmans algorithm (most frequent words have shorter binary equivalent)
# SPA overview
* SPAs allow different views (screens) to be loaded into shell page as the user interacts with the page
* desktop style UX - more fluent, faster etc
* by DOM manipulation
* `href="//site.com/#id"` would go to site.com and scroll to the id on that page
* similar to directory structure: `#/bookmark/1`
* pretend each hash value corresponds to the other page

#angularjs
## overview
* **Template** - HTML with additional markup
    * markup - language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate that text
    * template is parsed and processes by AngularJS compiler during application start
    * the view - loaded, transformed and rendered DOM
* **Directives** - extend HTML with custom attributes and elements
    * the only place where an application should access the DOM is within directives
* **Model** - the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
    * values that are stored in variables on the scope
* **Scope** - context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it
* **Expressions** - access variables and functions from the scope
    * allows AngularJS to read and write variables
    * `{{ expression | filter }}`
    * compiler replaces it with the evaluated value of the markup
* **Compiler** - parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions
* **Filter** - formats the value of an expression for display to the user
* **View** - what the user sees (the DOM)
* **Data Binding** - sync data between the model and the view
* **Controller** - the business logic behind views
    * exposes variables and functionality to expressions and directives
    * `InvoiceController as invoice` - instantiate the controller and save it in the variable 
    `invoice` in the current scope
* **Dependency Injection** - creates and wires objects and functions
    * everything within AngularJS (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) 
    is created and wired using dependency injection
* **Injector** - dependency injection container
* **Module** - a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, 
filters, directives which configures the Injector
    * when AngularJS starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the 
    `ng-app` directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on
* **Service** - reusable business logic independent of views




# angularjs
## introduction
1. global namespace with angular module
	* `var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);` // only one thing in global namespace; in [] we declare module that we depend on - othwerwise $injector.unpr when we inject $xxx that is included in that module
	* then in html below document attribute: ng-app="myApp" - matches to a module name
		* myApp.controller('mainController', () => {
			
		})
		* binding controller: ng-controller="mainController"
1. dependency injection - giving a function an object rather than creating an object inside a function
	```
 	function xxx() {
 		let p = new Yyy(...) // function is dependent on HOW the object is created
 		...
 	}
    ```
1. how does angularjs do dependency injection?
	* suppose we have `var f = function(a, b)`
	* `angular.injector().annotate(f)` returns `["a", "b"]` (array of param names)
	* ex. `params.includes("$scope")` and could inject it
	* minification could change param names `$scope -> a`
	    * minification does not touch strings
	* angularjs offers another approach to DI
	    * `myApp.controller('mainController', ($scope) => ...`
	    * `myApp.controller('mainController', ["$scope", scope => ...]`
1. event loop - js waits and listen for events (click, keypress, mouseover) in an event loop
	* angularjs is extending event loop by adding angular context
		* watchers - tracking and watch all values that can change watchlist (old value, new value)
			$scope.$watch('handle', (new, old) => {})
			* out of angular context
				setTimeout(() => {$scope.handle = 'aasdsd'; cl('scope changed!');}, 3000); // after 3 second will be logged, but not changed
				* all put in $scope.$apply( () => ...)
				* angularjs is usually put everything in $scope.$apply instead of you; it provides $timeout - you have to buy all with angularjs
		* digest loop - checked if something has changed? - it compared old value and new value from watchlist
1. enabling angularjs
	* `ng-app`: enables angularjs in the whole shell page (notifies angular that it will be angular page)
	* `ng-model="name"` - directive to bind with controller 
	    * `<input type="text" ng-model="name" />`
	    * `{{ name }}`
1. angularjs relies on two key architecture patterns:
	* model-view-controller
	* model-view-viewModel
	* mvc + mvvm = mv*
	* request -> controller <-> model 
				 controller <-> $scope (viewModel) <-> view -> response
	* `$scope` is injected into a controller
		* acts as the ViewModel
		* views bind to scope properties and functions
1. MV*
	* Model - data (var name = 'a')
	* View - html (what user sees)
	* bind: Model <-> View - whatever happens to the model affects view & one another
	* angulajs has a thing that can bind model to the view - watchers and the digest loop
1. key players
	* module - containers for components (controllers, services, directives)
	* routes - how to determine which view should be loaded (route is path, urls in browser); 
	    * can have ':', ex. `/customers/:customerId`
	* UI
		* view
		* directives - enhances html (binds the data to the view)
		* filters - data filter functionality, ex. uppercase
	* logic/data
		* controllers (binded to view by `$scope`)
		* factory
		* service
1. data binding overview
	* js has no native support for data binding
	* two-way data binding can lead to significant reduction in code
## directives
* angularjs - normalization: converts string into camel case: search-result -> (in code) -> searchResult
* restrict: 'AE' A - attribute, e-element; by default: AE; not supported by default: ex. class, comment
* directives enhance html with new features
* dom manipulation
	* `ng-hide`
	* `ng-repeat`
	* `ng-show`
	* `ng-view`
* data binding
	* `ng-bind`
	* `ng-init`
	* `ng-model`
* events
	* `ng-click`
	* `ng-keypress`
	* `ng-mouseenter`
* modules / controllers
	* `ng-app`
	* `ng-controller`
* most directives are used as attributes
* expressions in binding markup: `{{ xxx }}`
* `ng-clock` - dont load until is ready
* switch
    ```
    ng-switch="asd"
        ng-switch-when="..."
        ng-switch-default
    ```
* `ng-show="true"`
* `ng-class="data.status"`
1. common directives
	* `ng-if="condition"` - hide / show
	* `ng-show / ng-hide ="condition"` - hide / show
	* `ng-if` vs `ng-show`
		* `ng-if` - removes or recreates
		* `ng-show` - shows or hides
	* ng-class="{ 'alert-warning': handle.length < characters }" - decide what class to choose (alert, or OK); separate by comma
	* `ng-repeat="rule in rules"`
	* `ng-click="function from scope"`
	* `ng-clock` - prevent the AngularJS html template from being briefly displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading
1. `XMLHttpRequest`
	* can make request
	* angularjs equivalent - `$http`
	* `$http.get('/api').success(r => $scope.rules = result).error(e, status => )`
1. iterating over data
    ```
    ng-init="names=[{name:'John', city:'Chandler'}, ...]">
   	<li ng-repeat="person in persons"> {{ person.name }} </li>
    ```
1. directives and two way data binding
	* directives - changes DOM - ex. hide this
		* `ng-app`
		* `ng-controller`
		* two direction binding: `<input type="text" ng-model="handle"/>` and in controller `$scope.handle = ...`
1. role of directives
	* directives - markers on a DOM element that tell AngularJS HTML compiler ($compile)
		to attach a specified behaviour to that DOM element
		<div my-directive></div>
	* directives teach HTML new tricks
	* what can directives do:
		* manipulate the DOM
		* iterate through Data
		* handle events
		* modify css
		* data binding
	* key angularjs directives
		* forms
			* ng-maxlength, minlength, pattern, required, submit
		* behavior
			* ng-blur, change, checked, click, key*, mouse*
		* data binding
			* ng-bind, href, init, model, src, style
		* app
			* ng-app, ng-controller
		* DOM
			* ng-disabled, cloak, hide, if, repeat, show, switch, view
		* 3rd party directives
			* UI bootstrap
			* angularStrap
			* angular UI grid
			* angular translate
1. creating directive
	* app.directive('name', () => )
1. directive categories
	* DOM-Driven directives - all about DOM manipulation
	* Data-Driven Directives - all about data, using other directives and a controller
	* behavior-driven directives - all about handling DOM events
1. directives types
	* attribute directives <span my-dir="exp">
	* element directives <my-dir>
1. directive building blocks
	* template (html) <- merge -> Scope (data)
	* $compile provider - compiles an HTML string or DOM into a template and produces a template function,
		which can then be used to link scope and the template together.
	* DDO - directive definition object
		* restrict
		* template
		* templateUrl
		* scope
		* controller
		* link
		angular.module('moduleName')
			.directive('myDirective', () => {
				return {
					restrict: 'EA',
					scope: {},
					template: '<div>{{ myVal }}</div>',
					controller: controller,
					link: (scope, element, attrs) => ...
				}
		
		})
	* template
	* scope
1. shared and isolate scope
	* shared scope
		* on top: parent scope
		* on bottom: child scope
		* nested controllers
	* isolate scope
		* parent scope and child scope are separated
		* however we can communicate parent scope with child scope
		* scope: {} // isolate scope
		* @ local scope property
			* string with one-way binding
			$scope.first = 'Dave';
			scope: {name: '@'}
			<my-directive name="{{ first }}" />
		* = local scope property
			* object
			* without {{ }}
			* bi-directional binding
		* & local scope property
			* function
			* invoke external function
1. link() function
	* all about DOM manipulation
	* links the data to the view, template to the scope
	* (scope, element, attrs)
		* scope - isolate or shared scope
		* element - element directive is on
		* attrs - attributes of element
	* jqLite - subset of jquery that allows angular to manipulate the DOM-Driven
		* middleman between DOM and directive
		* key jqLite functions
			* angular.element()
			* addClass()/css()
			* attr()
			* on()/off()
			* find()
			* append()/remove()
			* html()/text()
			* ready()
	return {
		link: (scope, elem, attrs) => {elem.on('click', () => elem.html('You clicked me');}
	
	}
1. directives properties
	* restrict - Determines where a directive can be used (as an element, attribute, CSS class, or comment).
	* scope - Used to create a new child scope or an isolate scope
	* template - Defines the content that should be output from the directive. 
		Can include HTML, data binding expressions, and even other directives.
	* templateUrl Provides the path to the template that should be used by the directive. 
		It can optionally contain a DOM element id when templates are defined in <script> tags.
	* controller - Used to define the controller that will be associated with the directive template.
	* link - Function used for DOM manipulation tasks.
1. scope
	* isolate scope - in directive: scope: { } - instead of taking scope from the controller; good practice
		* if you want some from controller scope: <search-result person-name="{{ person.name }}"></search-result>
		* scope: {
			personName: "@" // matches person-name; expect text; one way binding
		}
		* then in view: {{ personName }}
	* person-object="person" whole object - how to say to angular that we need object
		* scope: {
			personObject: "=" // two way binding
		}
	* instead of object we want to have access to function
		$scope.formattedAddress = (aperson) => { }
		* in view - another attribute: formatted-address-function="formattedAddress(person)"
		* in directive
			scope: {
				formattedAddressFunction: "&"
			}
		* in the view
			{{formattedAddress({ aperson: personObject })}} // the same param as in the view
## sort, filter, formatting
* use pipe `|`
* `ng-repeat="cust in customers | orderBy:'name'"`
* key angularjs filters
	* `currency`
	* `date: cust.joined | date:'yyyy'`
	* `filter`
	* `json`
	* `limitTo`: `ng-repeat="cust in customers | limitTo: 2`
	* `lowercase`
	* `number`
	* `orderBy`
	* `uppercase`
* `ng-click="sortBy='name';reverse=!reverse"`
* `ng-repeat=cust in customers | orderBy:sortBy:reverse"`
1. `ng-controller` directive
	* `ng-controller="SimpleController"`
	* all scope values can be referenced from html inside the tag
	* controller `as` syntax
	    * `ng-controller="SimpleController as ctrl"`
	    * `ng-repeat="cust in ctrl.customers"`
		* easy to see from which controller property comes from
1. modules - are containers for:
	* controllers
	* routes
	* factories/services
	* directives
	* filters
	* `<html ng-app="moduleName">`
	* creating module: `var demoApp = angular.module('demoApp', [])`
	    * [] -> dependencies (other modules)
	* adding controller to module:
		* take module created before: demoApp.controller("SimpleController", function($scope) => )
		* angular.module('demoApp').controller(...)
		* SimpleController.$inject = ['$scope']
## routes - used for navigation
* angularjs routes associate a view with a controller
* customers.html <- /customers -> customersController
* relies on ngRoute module
* configured using $routeProvider
* specifies route - what should I do when I see particular thing in hash (pattern)
### configuration
```
var app = angular.module('customersApp', ['ngRoute']);
app.config($routeProvider => {
	$routeProvider
		.when('/',
			{
				controller: 'CustomersController',
				templateUrl: '/app/views/...'
		})
		.otherwise({ redirectTo: '/' });

});
```
* `$location`: `$location.path()` - after #, `#/bookmark/1 -> /bookmark/1`
* `ngRoute`, `$routeProvider` - specifies route - what should I do when I see particular thing in hash (pattern)
	```
	$routeProvider
		.when('/', {
			templateUrl: 'pages/main.html',
			controller: 'mainController'
		})
		.when('/second', {
			templateUrl: 'pages/second.html', // downloaded only when switched to appropriate URL
			controller: 'secondController'
		})
		.when('/second/:num/', { // pattern matching, second - slash - something
			templateUrl: 'pages/second.html',
			controller: 'secondController'
		})
    ```
* route parameter: `when('/editCustomer/:customerId', ...`
    * then in controller we inject `$routeParams` and we use name: `$routeParams.customerId`
* ng-view: <div ng-view> </div>
## factories, services
* singletons that perform re-useable tasks:
	* ajax calls
	* business rules
	* calculations
	* share data between controllers
* built-in services:
	* `$http`
	* `$timeout`
	* `$window`
	* `$location`
	* `$q`
	* `$rootScope`
	* `$interval`
	* `$filter`
	* `$log`
## factory
* define reusable tasks
* share code or state between controllers
* factories	
	* create and return a custom object
	* created using the module.factory() function
	* can be injected into other components
	* can have dependencies
* vs controller: controller is always new instance
* angular.module('asd').factory('factoryName', () => ... var factory = {}; factory.getCustomers = () => ...; return factory;)	
## service
* similar to a factory
* service function represents the returned object as opposed to a custom object like in a factory
	* change "factory." into "this."
1. scope service
	* all angularjs services starts with `$`
	* `$scope` is a complex object
	* `$scope` - bind a model to the view
	    ```
   		myApp.controller('mainController', ($scope) => { // angularjs inject it to the function
   			$scope.name = 'asd'; // add a property name with value 'asd', we can also add a function
   		})
        ```
        and then in view: `{{name}}`
        * code given below will change after 3 seconds value name in the view from 'xxx' to 'yyy'
            ```
			$scope.name = 'xxx';
			$timeout(function() {
				$scope.name = 'yyy';
			}, 3000);
			```
	* `$scope` defines data that will go back and forth between view and js script
	* `$scope` is new in every controller request (by DI)
1. useful angular services are
    * `$scope`
    * `$log`
    * `$http`
    * `$timeout`
1. ajax calls from factory / service
	* ajs can be used to make Ajax calls
	* $http, $resource
	* $http service
		* provides Ajax functionality
		* uses brower's XmlHttpRequest
		* asynchronous requests
		* relies on $q service's deferred/promise APIs
		* access data by calling then(), success(), error()
1. value: module.value(key, value); constant: module.constant(key, value)
	* constant vs value - value can't be injected into config(); constant - can be injected into config()
	* both can be injected in controllers etc...
1. using $log service
	* $log.log('')
